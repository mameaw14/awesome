# About Me

My name is Mameaw. I will use this to save useful links for me. Product, business, design, development things.

I didn't plan structure of this repo yet, if someone have a good idea please tell me in discussion area.

I plan to use issues to ask me questions and to jot the answer once I figgure it out.
